# pascal-voc-to-custom-vision-uploader

A simple script that converts XML files with Pascal VOC Annotations and uploads it with files to Custom Vision. XML files that were used were created in [LabelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg) 1.8.4.

#### Setup

Change `trainingKey`, `endPoint` and `filesPath` (relative or not relative) in the script to your own and run `npm start`.

#### Informations

The script is made as-is and probably won't be updated. You can edit it and use it anywhere you like.
